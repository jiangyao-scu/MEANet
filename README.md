# MEANet

Pytorch implementation for [MEANet:  Multi-Modal Edge-Aware Network for Light Field Salient Object Detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231222003502).


# Code and Usage
Coming soon.



# Saliency map
We relearsed two versions of the saliency map: 

Trained with additional 100 samples from HFUT-Lytro on [baidu pan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1VLCMMR9Rk1yrb6lrLvQ3xQ?pwd=rrwd) with fetch code: rrwd

Trained only with with DUTLF-FS on [baidu pan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1luKlhBIXL0HdqxwbZZkgqg?pwd=s7vn) with fetch code: s7vn
